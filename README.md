# Setup Server For Web Development
This repository contains files and scripts to help set up a local web server for web development. The setup is tailored to developers looking to configure a PHP-based environment using Apache.

Here's a GitHub README file template for your repository structure:


## Repository Structure

- **`setup-server-for-web-development/`**: The main directory containing all setup files.
  - **`config.inc.php`**: PHP configuration file to manage server settings and configurations.
  - **`httpd-vhosts.conf`**: Apache Virtual Hosts configuration file. It allows the server to differentiate between different sites hosted on the same IP address.
  - **`httpd.conf`**: Apache server configuration file. This file is essential for setting up and managing the Apache server.
  - **`index.php`**: The main PHP file to serve as the entry point of the web application.
  - **`setup.sh`**: A shell script to automate the setup and configuration of the server.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Apache HTTP Server
- PHP
- Bash (for running the shell script)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/setup-server-for-web-development.git
   cd setup-server-for-web-development
   ```

2. **Run the Setup Script**

   Execute the `setup.sh` script to set up the Apache server and PHP configuration.

   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   The script will automatically configure the Apache server based on the provided configuration files.

3. **Configure Apache and PHP**

   If additional configuration is needed, you can manually edit the following files:

   - `httpd.conf`
   - `httpd-vhosts.conf`
   - `config.inc.php`

   Restart the Apache server to apply the changes.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```

### Usage

After completing the setup, place your web development files in the appropriate directories and access your local server using the configured virtual hosts.
